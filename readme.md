# Sprint to Innovate 2023 - Web Prototype
This project is a prototype and mockup of a web application created in one day for the Sprint to Innovate 2023 competition. The prototype was developed using Proto.io to quickly visualize the design and user interactions. The project focuses on designing a system to analyze resumes and select the best candidates based on the SFIA (Skills Framework for the Information Age) framework.

## Project Overview
- Competition: Sprint to Innovate 2023
- Objective: Design a system for analyzing resumes and selecting the top candidates using the SFIA framework as the evaluation criteria.
- Tools Used: Proto.io for prototyping and mockup creation.
- Purpose: Provide a visual representation of the web applicationâ€™s layout and user flow for the competition.
## Features
- Resume Analysis: Utilize the SFIA framework to assess candidate skills and qualifications.
- Candidate Ranking: Automatically rank candidates based on their resumes scores.
- Interactive Mockups: Demonstrate key user interactions and navigation within the app.
- Rapid Prototyping: Quickly bring design ideas to life in a short time frame.
## Technologies Used
- Proto.io: For prototyping and interactive mockup development.
